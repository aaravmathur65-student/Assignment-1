    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>
      I’ve always been curious about how websites function and are built. Along
      with this, my interest in <br />Mathematics and Physics drives me to keep
      expanding my knowledge and exploring new ideas. <br />These subjects not
      only sharpen my problem-solving skills but also fuel my passion for coding
      and technology. <br />I’m eager to continue learning, improving, and
      applying my skills to create useful and innovative projects.
